# TITLE
AI to Feed the Future
## Overview and Origin

* Name of company
Caron Robotics see url: https://carbonrobotics.com/

* When was the company incorporated?
Founded in 2018 see url: https://carbonrobotics.com/company

* Who are the founders of the company?
Paul Mikesell see url: https://carbonrobotics.com/leadership

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
Paul Mikesell claims to have been motivated by looking for physical work applications of computer vision. He had already participated in the startup world via the company Isilon Systems and recognized that farmers would benefit from tools that improve the labor aspects of organic farming to make it more affordable. He worked with farmers in Oregon and Idaho and found that weed control was cited as one of the major issues, especially in terms of both cost to address and costs to profits. This naturally leads to company that makes a specialized medium tracktor sized robot which uses computer vision to identify weeds and zap them using lasers. see url: https://www.geekwire.com/2021/isilon-founder-lifts-hood-farming-startup-carbon-robotics-weed-zapping-machine/

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
Primarily via venture capital, in their most recent Series C round they recieved $30 million see url: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230411005018/en/Carbon-Robotics-Raises-30-Million-in-Funding-to-Scale-AI-Powered-LaserWeeder%E2%84%A2-Platform

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
The problem the company is aiming to solve is the intensive labor required to deal with weed control. see url: https://www.geekwire.com/2021/isilon-founder-lifts-hood-farming-startup-carbon-robotics-weed-zapping-machine/

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
The intended customers are generally farmers see url: see url: https://www.geekwire.com/2021/isilon-founder-lifts-hood-farming-startup-carbon-robotics-weed-zapping-machine/
Assuming that the intent of the company is to reach global markets then the projected gross production value of agriculture would be US$4.59 trillion see url: https://www.statista.com/outlook/io/agriculture/worldwide#:~:text=Agriculture%20%20-%20Worldwide%201%20Gross%20production%20value,projected%20to%20amount%20to%20US%24841.7bn%20in%202024.%20

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
It appears that the main benefit is weed control cost reduction without the usage of harmful herbicides see url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/ganeskesari/2024/03/31/the-future-of-farming-ai-innovations-that-are-transforming-agriculture/

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
A computer vision model that controls a laser which is beefy enough to require 24 GPUs per tractor.

The computer vision model is a neural network that is trained on the natural shapes of leaves etc to determine weed versus crop. See url: https://www.machinedesign.com/markets/robotics/article/55132497/carbon-robotics-the-vision-of-sustainable-agriculture-laser-focused-on-a-weed-free-farm

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?
A combination of agriculture and tech 
see url: https://www.geekwire.com/2021/isilon-founder-lifts-hood-farming-startup-carbon-robotics-weed-zapping-machine/

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?
By the looks of things, the major trends of agriculture are the same as they've always been since the dawn of human history which is technology, labor cost and availibility, and desires of various crops deeply affecting the locations in which foods are produced. The general trends for the past 5-10 years are that corn, soybeans, sugar, and wheat remain the highest consumed crops, that as countries and societies gain more income they tend to consume more meat, and that various health and climate change initiatives have possibility of shifting crop and animal demands. Major innovations mainly include products like "cultured meats" and plant based meat replacements. More recently there has been a push to automate farming in particular as tools to improve decision making.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
Mainly reduction of weed control costs see url: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240626367345/en/Carbon-Robotics%E2%80%99-LaserWeeders-Achieve-Milestone-Over-10-Billion-Weeds-Eliminated/

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?
Number of weeds destroyed, resulting crop yield, and reduction of weed control costs. See url: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240626367345/en/Carbon-Robotics%E2%80%99-LaserWeeders-Achieve-Milestone-Over-10-Billion-Weeds-Eliminated/
In addition they utilize acres examined per hour, accuracy in weed identification, false positive and false negative rates. See url: https://www.machinedesign.com/markets/robotics/article/55132497/carbon-robotics-the-vision-of-sustainable-agriculture-laser-focused-on-a-weed-free-farm

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
It appears to be performing well. Certainly better than AiGen which offers a less complex solar powered AI robot weed controller

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
It would be interesting to see if the robot could be bundled with a seeder that determines the likelihood of each seed of a given species germinating and planting the appropriate amounts per area in the row. This would reduce the need for thinning out seedlings along with reducing seed costs. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
It would provide a further cost cutting measure to reduce the operating costs of a farmer thereby further incentivizing a purchase. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
It 'should' be able to leverage the already present computer vision model, otherwise it might require an additional camera or chemical sensors and a seeding mechanical design to seed at appropriate depths. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
These technologies are appropriate as they would achieve an automation of the seeding process in a way that the human eye and hand would have difficulty doing on an industrial scale.
